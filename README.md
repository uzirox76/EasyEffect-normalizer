# EasyEffect-normalizer
EasyEffects effects chain to normalize volume

This is my EasyEffects chain of effects to make all the sounds play at the "same volume".
This is not entirely true, but it boost the low volume sounds and tryes to lower the high volume ones.
Note that the first effect is a "high pass filter" that cuts a lot of basses because my actual speakers are really small.
If you want more bass, remove the first filter.

** This works best with voice, not music. **
